        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Kenji Neijens i am 19 years old i live in a town called
          Pelt located in Limburg Belgium, my hobbys are playing video games,
          listening to music, going to the gym and hang out with friends. I
          studied Mechanical design techniques in highschool and here i got
          introduced to 3d programs like AutoCAD, since then i loved working at
          my desk spending time working on projects, after highschool i went to
          architectural drawing but this was not made for me. Then i saw
          programming and i am loving it untill this very day.

        <h2>
          why did I choose this course, and why does this profession fit me?
        </h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The reason i chose for this course is as i mentioned, i love spending
          time at my desk working on big projects. One of my hobbys is gaming so
          most of my time is already spent at my desk, there is something about
          programming that i love but its hard to point exactly what that is. It
          could be that when i work on a project its the satisfaction of the
          program working, seeing the progress you made. The profession that i
          like the most is designing website, as i said seeing the progress
          gives me satisfaction so does finding solutions to problems that i
          encounter and fix them.

        </h3>
        <p>
          At the moment i stand in a good position when it comes to designing i
          can see when a project is creatable or not.
        </p>
        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> What are my strongpoints?</h3>
        <p>
          My strongest point is the designing of a project (chosing what goes
          where, what colors, etc...).
        </p>
        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-x"></i> What are my weakpoints?</h3>
        <p>
          My least strongest point is when it comes to desinging is the
          back-end, while i am good in web related stuff things as C# and sql
          are my weakpoints, i find it quite hard to understand the process of
          it.

          moment?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I see myself pretty good at this aswell, i can use the tools that are
          at my disposal and i can work based on certain procedures.
        </p>
        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> What are my strongpoints?</h3>
        <p>
          Using the tools that are at my disposal and using the knowdledge that
          i have and gain from classes and implementing this in my projects.
        </p>
        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-x"></i> What are my weakpoints?</h3>

        <p>
          Not the best but also not the worst, i don't have a program that runs
          tests for me so i just test it myself and see where i run into
          problems/p>

        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, i see myself in the middle somewhere. Web
          development is my strongest point while C# is my weakest. I can always
          keep improving and keep on learning new things. But web is what i love doing the most.
