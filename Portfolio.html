          <hr>
          <p>Hi, my name is Kenji Neijens i am 19 years old i live in a town 
            called Pelt located in Limburg Belgium, my hobbys are playing video games,
            listening to music, going to the gym and hang out with friends. I studied 
            Mechanical design techniques in highschool and here i got introduced to 3d programs like AutoCAD, since then i loved working at my desk
            spending time working on projects, after highschool i went to architectural drawing but this was not made for me. 
            Then i saw programming and i am loving it untill this very day.</p>

          <h2>why did I choose this course, and why does this profession fit me?</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>The reason i chose for this course is as i mentioned,
             i love spending time at my desk working on big projects. One of my hobbys is gaming so most 
             of my time is already spent at my desk, there is something about programming that i love but
             its hard to point exactly what that is. It could be that when i work on a project 
             its the satisfaction of the program working, seeing the progress you made. 
             The profession that i like the most is designing website, as i said seeing the progress gives me satisfaction
             so does finding solutions to problems that i encounter and fix them.
            </p>
